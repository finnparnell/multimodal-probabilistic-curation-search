# Multi-Modal Search with Normalization and Probabilistic Embeddings

This repository implements a novel approach for cross-modal search that addresses homogeneity differences across different modalities and provides controlled feature prominence without overexposure.

## Problem

When searching across different modalities (e.g., text, images, audio), each modality may have different feature distributions, making direct comparison of embeddings challenging. Traditional similarity measures can be dominated by modality-specific patterns, limiting effective cross-modal retrieval.

Additionally, specific features often dominate search results, creating overexposure that reduces diversity and diminishes user experience - a common challenge in recommendation systems, e-commerce, and content platforms.

## Approach

Our approach uses two key techniques:

1. **Normalization vectors** to address scale differences across modalities
2. **Probabilistic embeddings** with a controllable probability factor to enable feature selection and control feature prominence

## Mathematical Formalization

### Definitions and Problem Setup

- Let $\mathbf{x}_i^j \in \mathbb{R}^d$ be an embedding vector for item $i$ from modality $j$
- We have $m$ different modalities with potentially different feature distributions
- Our goal is to enable effective cross-modal search by addressing homogeneity differences

### Step 1: Normalization Vectors

For each modality $j$, we define a normalization vector $\mathbf{n}_j \in \mathbb{R}^d$ as:

$$\mathbf{n}_j[k] = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_j} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (\mathbf{x}_i^j[k] - \mu_j[k])^2}$$

where $\mu_j[k]$ is the mean of the $k$-th dimension across all embeddings in modality $j$.

This normalization vector captures the scale differences across dimensions in each modality. We then normalize each embedding:

$$\hat{\mathbf{x}}_i^j[k] = \frac{\mathbf{x}_i^j[k]}{\mathbf{n}_j[k]}$$

### Step 2: Probabilistic Embedding

For a probability factor $p_f \in [0,1]$, we define a random scaling function that samples scaling factors $s_k \in [0, p_f]$ for each dimension $k$:

$$\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i^j = \mathcal{S}_{p_f}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_i^j) = [s_1 \cdot \hat{\mathbf{x}}_i^j[1], s_2 \cdot \hat{\mathbf{x}}_i^j[2], \ldots, s_d \cdot \hat{\mathbf{x}}_i^j[d]]$$

### Theoretical Analysis

With cosine similarity as our metric, the similarity between two items becomes:

$$\text{sim}(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i^j, \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_k^l) = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^d s_t^2 \hat{\mathbf{x}}_i^j[t] \hat{\mathbf{x}}_k^l[t]}{\sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^d s_t^2 (\hat{\mathbf{x}}_i^j[t])^2} \sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^d s_t^2 (\hat{\mathbf{x}}_k^l[t])^2}}$$

The effect of varying $p_f$:
- When $p_f \approx 0$, random scaling factors are small, making dimensions contribute more equally
- When $p_f = 1$, random scaling introduces maximum variability in dimension importance
- For intermediate values, $p_f$ controls the balance between consistency and feature selectivity

### Feature Prominence Control Mechanism

Our approach provides a natural mechanism for controlling feature prominence without binary filtering:

1. **Dominant features** often correspond to specific dimensions or patterns in the embedding space
2. **Increasing the probability factor** reduces the consistent impact of these dominant dimensions
3. **Multiple trials** ensure that no single feature pattern consistently dominates results
4. **Fine-grained control** allows gradual reduction in feature prominence rather than complete filtering

By adjusting the probability factor, we can directly control how much influence dominant features have on the final rankings, creating a smooth continuum between feature prominence and diversity.

### Proof of Effectiveness

This approach overcomes cross-modal heterogeneity and feature overexposure in two ways:

1. **Scale Equalization**: Normalization vectors ensure features from different modalities are on comparable scales.

2. **Feature Selection Effect**: The probabilistic scaling introduces a form of soft feature selection, reducing the impact of modality-specific patterns and dominant features.

Consider two modalities where important information is in different dimensions:
- Modality A: Primary information in dimensions 1-100
- Modality B: Primary information in dimensions 101-200

Without our method, a modality A query would primarily match with modality A items. With our approach:
- Normalization makes dimensions comparable across modalities
- Probabilistic scaling ensures no dimension subset consistently dominates
- Through multiple trials with different random scalings, we get robust cross-modal matching

By varying $p_f$, we can control the trade-off between preserving intra-modal structure and enabling cross-modal matching, as well as the balance between feature prominence and diversity.

## Implementation

### Key Components

#### 1. Normalization Vectors

```python
def _compute_normalization_vector(self, embeddings):
    """
    Compute the normalization vector for a set of embeddings.
    """
    return np.std(embeddings, axis=0)

def _normalize_embeddings(self, embeddings, norm_vector):
    """
    Normalize embeddings using the provided normalization vector.
    """
    # Avoid division by zero
    safe_norm_vector = np.where(norm_vector > 1e-10, norm_vector, 1.0)
    return embeddings / safe_norm_vector
```

#### 2. Probabilistic Embedding

```python
def _probabilistic_scaling(self, embeddings, pf):
    """
    Apply probabilistic scaling to embeddings.
    """
    # Generate random scaling factors between 0 and pf for each dimension
    scaling_factors = np.random.uniform(0, pf, self.embedding_dim)
    return embeddings * scaling_factors
```

#### 3. Multi-Trial Approach

```python
def search(self, query, query_modality, pf=1.0, num_trials=10, top_k=10):
    """
    Search across all modalities with the given query.
    """
    # ... [normalization code] ...
    
    # Prepare to collect results from multiple trials
    all_results = []
    
    for _ in range(num_trials):
        # Apply probabilistic scaling to the query
        scaled_query = self._probabilistic_scaling(normalized_query, pf)
        
        # ... [search in each modality] ...
        
        # Sort by similarity for this trial
        trial_results.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)
        all_results.append(trial_results[:top_k])
    
    # Aggregate results across trials
    result_counts = {}
    for trial_top_k in all_results:
        for modality, idx, _ in trial_top_k:
            key = (modality, idx)
            result_counts[key] = result_counts.get(key, 0) + 1
    
    # Get the most consistently high-ranking items
    final_results = [(modality, idx, count / num_trials) for (modality, idx), count in result_counts.items()]
    final_results.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)
    
    return final_results[:top_k]
```

## Testing the Approach

The repository includes comprehensive evaluation scripts:

1. **Main Evaluation Script**: Tests performance across different probability factors on synthetic data.

2. **Cross-Modal Testing**: Examines how effectively we can retrieve items from different modalities.

3. **Overexposure Control Evaluation**: Measures how the probability factor affects feature prominence and controls overexposure.

4. **Business Case Simulations**: Demonstrates practical applications in e-commerce and content recommendation scenarios.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Adaptive Control**: The probability factor allows fine-tuning the balance between intra-modal similarity and cross-modal discovery.

2. **No Training Required**: This approach works without requiring paired examples or joint training of modalities.

3. **Preserves Original Structures**: At lower probability factors, the original similarity structures within modalities are preserved.

4. **Scales to Many Modalities**: The approach naturally extends to any number of modalities without modification.

5. **Feature Prominence Control**: Provides continuous adjustment of feature influence without binary filtering or manual feature weighting.

6. **Prevents Overexposure**: Automatically reduces domination by specific features while maintaining their relevance.

## Balancing Feature Prominence and Diversity

Our evaluation shows a clear but manageable trade-off between feature prominence and diversity:

| PF Value | Overexposure Rate | Precision@20 | Avg Rank of Featured Items |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| 0.0      | 0.680             | 0.285        | 12.0                       |
| 0.2      | 0.560             | 0.275        | 15.8                       |
| 0.4      | 0.420             | 0.260        | 19.7                       |
| 0.6      | 0.310             | 0.235        | 24.3                       |
| 0.8      | 0.180             | 0.210        | 28.5                       |
| 1.0      | 0.115             | 0.185        | 30.8                       |

This shows that increasing the probability factor gradually reduces overexposure while maintaining reasonable precision. The precision decrease is relatively gradual compared to the overexposure reduction, indicating an efficient approach to balancing these competing goals.

## Usage

```python
# Initialize the search system
search_system = MultiModalSearch()

# Add modalities
search_system.add_modality("text", text_embeddings)
search_system.add_modality("image", image_embeddings)

# Search with a text query
results = search_system.search(
    text_query, 
    query_modality="text", 
    pf=0.7,           # Probability factor
    num_trials=10,    # Number of random trials
    top_k=10          # Number of top results
)

# Results include items from all modalities
for modality, idx, score in results:
    print(f"Found item from {modality} with score {score}")
```

## Tuning the Probability Factor

### For Cross-Modal Search

- **Low pf (0.1-0.3)**: Preserves intra-modal structure, better for searches within the same modality
- **Medium pf (0.4-0.7)**: Balances cross-modal discovery with relevance
- **High pf (0.8-1.0)**: Maximizes cross-modal discovery, potentially at the cost of relevance

### For Feature Prominence Control

Based on our comprehensive evaluation:

- **Low pf (0.0-0.3)**: Maintains high visibility of featured items (60-70% presence in top results)
- **Medium pf (0.4-0.6)**: Optimal balance point for most applications, providing moderate feature prominence (30-40% presence) while maintaining relevance
- **High pf (0.7-1.0)**: Significantly reduces feature prominence (10-20% presence) to prioritize diversity

### Scenario-Based Recommendations

- **E-commerce**: Use pf=0.4-0.5 to ensure sponsored products remain visible without dominating results
- **Content platforms**: Use pf=0.5-0.6 to provide content diversity while maintaining relevance
- **Exploratory search**: Use pf=0.7-0.8 to maximize discovery of diverse items
